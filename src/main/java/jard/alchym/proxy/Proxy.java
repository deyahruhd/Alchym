/***
 *  Proxy
 *  An abstract proxy class designed to cleanly separate the two logical sides that code can run on. Code that must run
 *  on both logical sides should be placed in the Alchym class, while code that is eventually delegated to a side
 *  should be placed as methods within this class and overrided within ServerProxy or ClientProxy
 *
 *  This prevents abuse of the proxying system to call code on both logical sides.
