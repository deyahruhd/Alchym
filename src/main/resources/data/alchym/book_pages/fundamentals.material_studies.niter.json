    "Niter is a relatively uncommon substance that occurs in large surface-level deposits. Mining niter-bearing stone will usually shatter the mineral to yield \\emphasis{Niter Powder}, though sometimes a \\emphasis{Niter Crystal} or two may survive the blunt force. These crystals are very valuable for both Alchymical research and practical Alchymistry, and should be gathered accordingly.",
    "The most important property of niter is its latent Alchymical power. When brought in contact with a group of substances either in-world or in-solution, the powder releases its energy to violently consume the ingredients, including itself. This produces a new substance, usually very dissimilar to its constituent ingredients.",
    "\\heading{Symbolism.}",
    "The Alchymical symbol for Niter is a circle with a vertical dash through it, which is said to represent the division of matter into two unstable halves.",
    "Alchymists of old likened niter to the principle of \\emphasis{Volatility}, where its mere presence drives the purification forces of the universe to Transmute various forms of matter into different Alchymically-favorable forms. Niter, thus, plays a significant role as the principle reagent in Alchymical transmutations."
